This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python, designed for two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns inputting their moves, with 'X' for Player 1 and 'O' for Player 2, while the game ensures input validation and checks for winning conditions. The board is displayed in the console, showing current positions, and the game will announce the winner or declare a draw when applicable. To run the game, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and execute the Python script. Enjoy this engaging game and feel free to contribute or suggest improvements!
